### Project Overview
---
As part of the classification project, three essential R functions for classification tasks are being developed. The project's goal is to categorize numerical values into distinct groups according to predetermined thresholds by analyzing various datasets.
The B_Classifier, C_Classifier, and O_Classifier functions are the three that I developed. Every function has a unique function and is linked to a particular dataset.

### Data Sources

Classification Data: The primary dataset used for this analysis is the "dataset_b0.csv","dataset_b0.csv" "c0", to "c499" file, containing detailed information about the vector values: ('bo' or 'bn'), ('cw' or 'cb') and ('o0', 'o1', ..., 'o9').
